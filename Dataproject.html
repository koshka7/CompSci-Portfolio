    <h3> What Even is This Data Project?</h3>
    <p>This project is here for the purpose of just basically having something to go under the "Other Computer Science Projects" page on the main website.  What this project actually is, however, is a simple method to determine how your pet guinea pig is feeling or whether it is healthy or not.*</p>  
 <p><small>*Please don't use this in place of an actual vet.  If you think something is actually wrong with your pet, get them checked out by someone who knows what they're doing.</small></p>
