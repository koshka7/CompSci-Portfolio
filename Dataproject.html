    <h3> What Even is This Data Project?</h3>
    <p>This project is here for the purpose of just basically having something to go under the "Other Computer Science Projects" page on the main website.  What this project actually is, however, is a simple method to determine how your pet guinea pig is feeling or whether it is healthy or not.*</p>  

    <h3>Basic Information</h3>
    <p>This project is a collection of sound made by Cheddar, the "control" guinea pig.  Cheddar is an average and healthy 4 year old guinea pig.  She is fed a combination of timothy hay and romaine lettuce every morning around 7:00 to 8:00 AM, and gets a fresh helping of timothy hay, along with a clean cage, every day at around 5:30 PM.</p>
    <p>The basic idea is to review Cheddar's data and compare it to another guinea pig to get a loose idea of how the guinea pig is feeling.</p>
    <p>Cheddar does not share a cage with any other animals.  Guinea pigs that live together will most likely make more noise, as they are social animals. Additionally, Cheddar may have different likes and dislikes from your guinea pig.  For example, she doesn't like when someone removes her blanket bedding to be washed and disinfected.</p>
