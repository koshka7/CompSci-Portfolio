    <h3> What Even is This Data Project?</h3>
    <p>This project is here for the purpose of just basically having something to go under the "Other Computer Science Projects" page on the main website.  What this project actually is, however, is a simple method for use by guinea pig owners to determine how your pet guinea pig is feeling or whether it is healthy or not.*</p>  

    <h3>Basic Information</h3>
    <p>The data for this project is a collection of sound made by Cheddar, the "control" guinea pig.  Cheddar is an average and healthy 4 year old guinea pig.  She is fed a combination of timothy hay and romaine lettuce every morning around 7:00 to 8:00 AM, and gets a fresh helping of timothy hay, along with a clean cage, every day at around 5:30 PM.</p>
    <p>The basic idea is to review Cheddar's data and compare it to another guinea pig to get a loose idea of how the guinea pig is feeling.</p>
    <p>Cheddar does not share a cage with any other animals.  Guinea pigs that live together will most likely make more noise, as they are social animals. Additionally, Cheddar may have different likes and dislikes from your guinea pig.  For example, she doesn't like when someone removes her blanket bedding to be washed and disinfected.  Guinea pigs may display a dislike of something with chattering of teeth (also known as a durr sound).</p>
    
    <h3>The Actual Data Behind This Project</h3>
        <table style="width:100%">
      <tr>
        <th>Type of Sounds Made</th>
        <th>Time Recorded</th>
        <th> Other Notes</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Slight Squeaking</td>
        <td>4:02 PM, 7/21/17</td>
        <td>none</td>
      </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Slight Squeaking</td>
            <td>5:40 PM, 7/21/17</td>
            <td>none</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Lots of Squeaking</td>
            <td>8:13 AM, 7/22/17</td>
            <td>Was most likely hungry; she recieves food daily around this time</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Slight Squeaking</td>
            <td>11:03 AM, 7/22/17</td>
            <td>none</td>
          </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h3>How Could This Data Become More Accurate?</h3>
    
    <p>The best way to improve this data would be to pay attention.  Stay near your guinea pig, and record whatever noise they make.  If you are a sensible person who simply can't sit and watch your guinea pig all night, then go get a camera and record them or something.  If you really wanted you, you could probably set up a live feed, so you could always watch them.  Simply put, you can't tell if your guinea pig is healthy based on the sounds they make if you're not there to hear it.</p> 
    
    
    <h3>Final Thoughts and Conclusion</h3>
    
    <p>This was the squeaking I had recorded from Cheddar from 7/21 to 7/22.  I did not record any squeaking at night.  Once again, Cheddar is an older and healthy guinea pig.  Obviously, the data used for this project in comparison to other guinea pigs is not perfect, but a main "cycle" for when a guinea pig will make these sounds should become clear as more data is recorded.  The sounds your guinea pig makes, and at what time, with likely become more of a pattern, such as when they burst into fits of squeaking for food, or chatter their teeth when they are separated from their cage.</p>
